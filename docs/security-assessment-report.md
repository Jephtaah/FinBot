# FinBot Security Assessment Report
*Date: 2025-07-12*
*Assessor: Security Analysis*

## Executive Summary

This security assessment of the FinBot application has identified **3 Critical** and **5 High** severity vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The primary concerns revolve around admin role management, authentication bypasses, and insufficient access controls.

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Immediate action required before production deployment.

## Methodology

This assessment examined:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Database Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- API routes and server actions
- Client-side security patterns
- Admin functionality security
- Data handling and validation

## Critical Severity Vulnerabilities


### ðŸŸ¢ CRITICAL-002: RLS Policy Infinite Recursion Risk (RESOLVED)
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/20250712130000_make_admin_check_robust.sql`

**Description:** âœ… **FIXED** - Enhanced the admin check function with explicit RLS bypass and comprehensive error handling to prevent recursion issues.

**Solution Implemented:**
```sql
create or replace function public.auth_user_is_admin()
returns boolean
language plpgsql
security definer
stable
set search_path = ''
as $$
declare
  result boolean := false;
  current_user_id uuid;
begin
  current_user_id := auth.uid();
  if current_user_id is null then
    return false;
  end if;
  
  -- explicitly disable row level security
  set local row_security = off;
  
  select exists (
    select 1 from public.profiles 
    where id = current_user_id and role = 'admin'
  ) into result;
  
  return coalesce(result, false);
exception
  when others then
    return false; -- fail closed
end;
$$;
```

**Security Improvements:**
- âœ… Explicit `row_security = off` to prevent RLS recursion
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling that fails closed
- âœ… Input validation and null checks
- âœ… Security definer with search_path protection
- âœ… Maintains existing data structure

### ðŸŸ¡ CRITICAL-003: Admin Data Access (CLARIFIED - BY DESIGN)
**Location:** `app/admin/page.tsx:18-41`

**Description:** âœ… **CLARIFIED** - Admin users have full access to all user data by design. This is intentional and properly secured through database-level RLS policies.

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
const { data: revenueData } = await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .select('amount')
  .eq('type', 'income')
```

**Security Status:**
- âœ… Admins are manually created in database (controlled access)
- âœ… RLS policies grant full access to admin roles
- âœ… Admin access is protected by server-side authentication
- âœ… Admin pages require proper role verification

**Design Rationale:**
- Admins need full access for administrative functions
- Access is controlled at database level through RLS
- Manual admin creation prevents unauthorized escalation

**Optional Enhancement (Medium Priority):**
- Consider adding audit logging for admin actions for compliance
- Not a security vulnerability, but useful for governance

## High Severity Vulnerabilities

### ðŸŸ  HIGH-001: Client-Side Admin Role Check with Fail-Open Pattern
**Location:** `lib/utils/auth.ts:7-22`

**Description:** Admin role verification happens client-side and fails open (returns false) on errors rather than failing closed.

**Code Evidence:**
```typescript
export async function isCurrentUserAdmin(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const supabase = createClient()
    const { data: isAdmin, error } = await supabase.rpc('auth_user_is_admin')
    
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error checking admin status:', error)
      return false  // Fails open!
    }
    
    return isAdmin || false
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in isCurrentUserAdmin:', error)
    return false  // Fails open!
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Client-side checks can be bypassed
- Security fails open rather than closed
- No server-side validation backup

**Recommendation:** Move admin checks to server-side with fail-closed error handling.

### ðŸŸ  HIGH-002: Insufficient Input Validation for Financial Data
**Location:** `lib/actions/profile.ts:35-65`

**Description:** Financial data updates lack proper validation and sanitization, using direct parsing without bounds checking.

**Code Evidence:**
```typescript
const monthlyIncome = formData.get('monthlyIncome') as string
const monthlyExpenses = formData.get('monthlyExpenses') as string

monthly_income: monthlyIncome ? parseFloat(monthlyIncome) : null,
```

**Impact:**
- Potential injection attacks
- Data corruption through malformed input
- Financial data integrity issues

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all financial inputs.

---

### ðŸŸ  HIGH-003: Overly Broad Storage Bucket Permissions
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/20241227140000_create_receipt_images_table.sql:74-78`

**Description:** Storage policy allows any authenticated user to view receipt images in the bucket.

**Code Evidence:**
```sql
create policy "authenticated users can view receipt images"
on storage.objects
for select
to authenticated
using ( bucket_id = 'receipts' );
```

**Impact:**
- Users can access other users' receipt images
- Privacy violation of financial documents
- Potential data leakage

**Recommendation:** Restrict receipt access to owners only using user ID validation.

---

### ðŸŸ  HIGH-004: Chat API Lacks Rate Limiting and Abuse Protection
**Location:** `app/api/chat/route.ts:10-106`

**Description:** The chat API endpoint has no rate limiting, message length validation, or abuse detection mechanisms.

**Impact:**
- API abuse potential
- DoS attack vector
- Excessive OpenAI API costs
- Service availability issues

**Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting, message validation, and abuse detection.

---

### ðŸŸ  HIGH-005: Sensitive Data Exposure to Third-Party AI Service
**Location:** `app/api/chat/route.ts:54-79`

**Description:** Financial data is transmitted to OpenAI without explicit user consent verification.

**Code Evidence:**
```typescript
const contextPrompt = context ? `
  Here's the user's financial context:
  
  PROFILE INFORMATION:
  - Name: ${context.profile?.fullName || 'User'}
  - Email: ${context.profile?.email || 'Not specified'}
  - Monthly Income: ${context.profile?.monthlyIncome ? \`$${context.profile.monthlyIncome}\` : 'Not specified'}
```

**Impact:**
- Sensitive financial data sent to third-party
- Privacy compliance violations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Data sovereignty issues

**Recommendation:** Implement explicit consent mechanisms and data minimization for AI processing.
